# CSS-JS-CLOCK
#
# GOAL: Following along with JS-30 I want to create a css and javascript clock
#
#
# First I decided to create a box with a width and a height of 400px. I used a small border at first to see the size I wished
#
#
# Next I used flexbox to center the box so it would be in the center of the page
